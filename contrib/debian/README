This directory contains files used to package yiffcoind/yiffcoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile yiffcoind/yiffcoin-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

yiffcoin: URI support
--------------------

yiffcoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install yiffcoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your yiffcoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/yiffcoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

yiffcoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
